The only way to get better at algorithms is to just do them. I plan to work
my way through a bunch of contest problems, starting with UVa and TopCoder 
in order to better my coding and theory skills. 

Ultimately, I would like to actually compete in TopCoder SRMs.

To be honest, I also just need to get better at C++.
